# PhD Student Webpage

This is a Single Page Application (SPA) created for a PHD student to showcase their work and provide information about their research.

## Features
- Responsive design;
- Sections for research projects, publications, teaching, and contact information;
- Interactive elements using JQuery;

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (with JQuery lib)

## Getting Started
1. Open (https://fredericopap.github.io/PHD-StudentWebSite/) in your web browser if you want to take a look.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/FredericoPAP/PHD-StudentWebSite.git`;
3. There are 2 branch versions if you want to test the website, I suggest the one with JQuery(Version-2.0-with-JQuery). The other ones are with simple JavaScript features.

Enjoy!
